<h2>Meet Jacob Goodman</h2>
<p>

Brother Alumnus Jacob Goodman graduated from Washington University in May 2014. Until then, Jacob was one of the most recognizable faces around our chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi and easily one of the most liked. In addition to being a full-time student in his time at Washington University, Jacob was co-running two companies. The first was University Trucking, Inc., with several other owners. Jacob's function at the time he graduated was that of CFO. At Fresh Prints, a custom designing and printing apparel company, Jacob was the co-president. As Utrucking is part of the Washington University Entrepreneurial Program (StEP), Jacob had to sell his stake in the company upon graduation. However, he and co-president Joshua Arbit have continued running Fresh Prints after graduation, and have experienced growth as they have committed to it full-time. Jacob is also now the CTO of a new company called College Truckers, which is working to grow a presence in the shipping and storage of students' belongings in several universities throughout the United States. Jacob's entrepreneurial spirit and success are a testament to the type of special people in our chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi.</p>
