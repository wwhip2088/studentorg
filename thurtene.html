         <h3>Tradition and History</h3>
    <p>The main purpose of ThurtenE Carnival is to bring together the Washington University and Greater St. Louis communities for three days of exhilarating rides, live performances, and delicious food. It is the largest and oldest student-run carnival in the nation, organized by members of ThurtenE Honorary at Washington University. As is pertains to AEPi, every year, fraternities and sororities at Washington University pair up to create facades for Thurtene. During Thurtene weekend, each fraternity and sorority is judged on their spirit, play, and construction, as well as their overall performance. Each year, a committee of Thurtene overalls judge each pairing on these qualities.<br><br> </p>

         <h3>Welcome to Our City Block</h3>
    <p>For the past several years, Alpha Epsilon Pi has been paired with Pi Beta Phi. This year, our chosen theme was that of a City Block. The facade featured several super-structures, including models of a bodega, a subway sign, a bookstore, a pizza shop, a deli, a "boomingdales", and the off-campus apartments where many senior members of AEPi and PiPhi reside. For our efforts, the AEPiBetaPhi team took home the overall award called The Burmeister, as well as the Spirit award.</p>

         <h3>John Drescher and Steve Evans</h3>
    <p>John and Steve were the engine behind the construction of our award-winning facade. They spent countless hours at the Thurtene lot (where construction gets done), and really committed themselves to this pursuit this semester. It's hard to explain without seeing it yourself, but the entire fraternity is very thankful for the efforts, and every overall that does this each year, (but especially Steve and John because we won.) John Drescher is a senior in AEPi and part of the Spring 2012 Pledge Class. He will be teaching English in Nice, France next year and living in a chateau. Steve Evans is a 5th year senior in AEPi and part of the 2011 Spring Pledge Class. He is completing a degree in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
