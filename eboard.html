<h1>Executive Board</h1><br>

<p>Our Executive Board is the governing body of our chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi. Some positions, such as Master, House Manager, and Recruitment chair are full academic year positions, running in this case from Fall 2014 through Spring 2015. All other positions are semester-long positions, however it is certainly possible for an individual to hold this position for the full academic year. Serving on Executive Board brings a lot of responsibility and work, and plays an essential role in our fraternity. Without our executive board, we cannot function as a fraternity, and we are grateful to everyone who takes a turn doing their part.</p><br><br>
